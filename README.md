# AoC puzzles

- [Advent of code website](https://adventofcode.com/)
- I won't add inputs. [Note from aoc](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about):

  Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code? Please don't. Advent of Code
  is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, 
  please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.

- The goals is to resolve puzzle not matter how hackish it is
